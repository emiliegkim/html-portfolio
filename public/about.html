<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Emilie Ga Eun Kim</h2>

<p>I'm an undergraduate student at UFCSPA in Biomedical Informatics. I want to work in medical innovation through technology resources by creating solutions and results. 
  Furthermore, I believe in the value generated by unifying people and common purposes; 
  therefore, I always seek new connections and different skills to explore various areas and experiences that contribute to my personal and professional development.</p>
